    <p>
      Sorrel is the Jamaican word for hibiscus, a flower which grows abundantly
      on the island. Even though this drink is served on ice, sorrel retains the
      flavors of the holiday season – cinnamon, all spice, fresh ginger. For
      those who wish, rum sends it over the edge for a truly relaxing holiday
      season.This beverage can be served with and without liquor.

    <ul>
      <li>

        cold water in a colander or strainer
      </li>
      <li>
        3/4 pound (350g) peel-on fresh ginger, washed and grated (see note)
      </li>
      <li>10 whole cloves</li>
      <li>10 allspice berries, roughly crushed with the side of a knife</li>
      <li>1 pound 1 1/2 ounces (495g; about 2 1/2 cups) sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup beer</li>
      <li>½ cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
      <li>1 jalapeno pepper, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced capers</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 quart oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 pound cod fillets, cut into 2 to 3 ounce portions</li>
      <li>1 package corn tortillas</li>
      <li>1 ½ medium head cabbage, finely shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>
        In a 4- or 5-quart pot or Dutch oven, bring 3 quarts water to a boil.
        Add sorrel, grated ginger, cloves, and crushed allspice, and boil until
        the sorrel begins to plump and swell, about 8 minutes.
      </p>

      <li>Step 2</li>
      <p>
        Remove from heat and let stand until cooled, then continue to steep in
        an airtight vessel in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours and up to 3
        days.
      </p>

      <li>Step 3</li>
      <p>
        Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer or through cheesecloth
        into a large pitcher, pressing on solids to express as much liquid as
        possible. If needed, strain again until it is clear of any ginger
        remnants. Discard solids.
      </p>

      <li>Step 4</li>
      <p>
        In a 2-quart saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil with the sugar.
        Continue to cook, stirring, until sugar has completely dissolved. Remove
        simple syrup from heat.
      </p>

      <li>Step 5</li>
      <p>
        Stir simple syrup into the strained sorrel, 1/2 cup at a time, until
        desired sweetness level is reached.
      </p>

      <li>Step 6</li>
      <p>Chill until ready to drink. Serve over ice.</p>

      <p>
        Notes For this quantity of ginger, it's best to use a box grater or even
        the grating disc on a food processor (the fibers will clog up a
        Microplane or other fine grater very quickly).
      </p>

      <p>
        Make-Ahead and Storage The strained sorrel can be kept refrigerated for
        up to 5 days.
