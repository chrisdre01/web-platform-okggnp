      Holidays in the Caribbean always bring back fond memories. In addition to all of 
      the partying and celebrating, my favorite memories were sitting down at the table 
      with my family to enjoy a great meal. Having a healthy breakfast is very important, 
      and my favorite breakfast meal is called “ackee and salt fish with festival.”</p>
      
    <p>A common misconception about ackee is that it contains a lot of cholesterol and unhealthy fats. 
       Other elements present in lower amounts include phosphorous, potassium, sodium, chlorine, zinc, iron, calcium, and magnesium. There are very small amounts of other elements present, including selenium and fluorine.</p>
